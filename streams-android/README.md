# Streams — Android app (Kotlin + Jetpack Compose + Supabase)

A native Android streaming app with a **Home / Channels / Shows / Profile** bottom bar, Free / Premium / Exclusive content, manual UPI payments verified by an admin, and a hidden admin panel for uploads, payments, channels, campaigns and team access.

## Step 1 — Install the tools (one time)

1. Install **Android Studio** from https://developer.android.com/studio and open it once so it downloads the Android SDK.
2. Get this code on your computer: on GitHub, open the branch `claude/practical-ptolemy-cuvsp8`, click **Code → Download ZIP**, and unzip it. (Or `git clone` and check out that branch.)

## Step 2 — Create the backend on Supabase (free)

1. Go to https://supabase.com → **New project**. Pick a region close to India (e.g. Mumbai). Save the database password somewhere safe.
2. Open `supabase/schema.sql` in any text editor. Near the bottom, replace
   `YOUR_OWNER_EMAIL@example.com` with **your own email** (the one you'll use for admin).
3. In Supabase: **SQL Editor → New query**, paste the whole file, click **Run**. It should say "Success".
   This creates every table, all the security rules, the 5 plans (₹99 / ₹149 / ₹259 / ₹599 / ₹999), your UPI ID `2728412a@bandhan`, and the two storage buckets.
4. (Optional but recommended) **Database → Extensions** → enable `pg_cron`, then run the two commented lines at the very end of `schema.sql`. This marks expired plans every 30 minutes. (Expired plans stop working immediately even without it — this only tidies up the status.)

## Step 3 — Sign-in settings in Supabase

**Authentication → URL Configuration**
- Site URL: `streams://login-callback`
- Redirect URLs — add both:
  - `streams://login-callback`
  - `streams://login-callback/**`

**Authentication → Providers → Email**: make sure it is **enabled**. (This covers magic links and the admin password.)

**Authentication → Providers → Google** — use **your own** Google credentials:
1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com → create a project called "Streams".
2. **APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen** → External → fill in app name "Streams", your email → Save. Then **Publish app** (otherwise only test users can sign in).
3. **APIs & Services → Credentials → Create credentials → OAuth client ID** → type **Web application**.
   - Authorized redirect URI: `https://YOUR-PROJECT-REF.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
     (copy the exact value shown on the Supabase Google provider page).
4. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client secret** into Supabase's Google provider and **Save**.

**Email sending (important before launch):** Supabase's built-in email is heavily rate-limited (only a few emails per hour). Before real customers use magic links, set up your own SMTP under **Project Settings → Authentication → SMTP** (Resend, Brevo, Zoho, Gmail SMTP, etc.).

**Video size:** on the free plan, each uploaded file is limited to 50 MB. For full-length videos, upgrade to Pro and raise **Storage → Settings → Upload file size limit**.

## Step 4 — Keys (already done)

The app is already connected to the Streams Supabase project (`kpnfncydvpzlrcjplazh`, Mumbai): its URL and public anon key are built in via `app/build.gradle.kts`. To point the app at a different project, put `SUPABASE_URL=` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=` lines in `local.properties` (or GitHub Actions secrets with the same names) — those override the built-in values.

## Step 5 — Open and run in Android Studio

1. Android Studio → **File → Open** → select the `streams-android` folder (the one containing `settings.gradle.kts`).
2. Wait for **Gradle sync** to finish (bottom bar). The first sync downloads libraries and takes a few minutes. If Android Studio offers to upgrade the Android Gradle Plugin, you can accept.
3. Plug in your Android phone with **USB debugging** on (Settings → About phone → tap Build number 7 times → Developer options → USB debugging), or create an emulator via **Device Manager**.
4. Press the green **Run ▶** button.

> If Gradle sync or the build shows a red error, copy the error text and send it to me — I'll fix it.

## Step 6 — Set your admin password (first time) and log in to admin

The admin area isn't linked anywhere in the app. To open it:

1. Go to **Profile** and tap the small **"Streams 1.0.0"** text at the bottom **7 times** → the **Admin sign in** page opens.
2. Type your owner email, then tap **"Forgot password? / Set first password"**.
3. Open the email **on the same phone** and tap the link → the app opens **Set admin password**. Choose a password.
4. You're in the admin dashboard. Next time, just use email + password on the Admin sign in page.

If someone signs in there who is not on the admin list, they are signed straight back out and see "This account doesn't have admin access".

## Step 7 — Add your content

In **Admin**:
1. **Channels** → *New channel* (e.g. Drama, Comedy). Tick "Contains premium content" if it applies.
2. **Content** → *Upload* → follow the 8 steps: type (single video / series), name & description, channel, thumbnail, optional trailer, main video, who can watch (Free / Premium / Hidden Premium), and Publish. New uploads are **drafts** by default.
3. In the Content list: tap **DRAFT/LIVE** to publish/unpublish, tap the **tier badge** to cycle Free → Premium → Exclusive, ⭐ to feature a title in the Home hero, ✏️ to edit (and add more episodes to a series), 🗑 to delete.
4. **Campaigns** → a short banner shown at the top of Home while active.
5. **Team** (owner only) → add manager emails. **Settings** (owner only) → change the UPI ID / payee name.

## Web admin panel (for computers)

`docs/index.html` in this repository is a browser version of the admin panel (same features: stats, payments, uploads with a progress bar, channels, campaigns, team, settings). It is published with GitHub Pages:

1. GitHub repo → **Settings → Pages** → Source: **Deploy from a branch** → Branch: the branch containing `docs/` (e.g. `main` after merging) → Folder: **/docs** → Save.
2. After ~1 minute it is live at `https://sahilchandpara008-pixel.github.io/shopify-mcp-v1/`.
3. For “Forgot password?” on the web panel, add `https://sahilchandpara008-pixel.github.io/**` to Supabase → Authentication → URL Configuration → Redirect URLs.

Only owner/manager accounts can sign in; everyone else is signed straight back out, and the database rejects admin actions from anyone else anyway.

## How payments work

1. Customer picks a plan on **Profile** → taps **Open UPI app** (amount pre-filled) or pays manually to the UPI ID shown.
2. Customer types the **UTR / reference number** and taps **Submit for verification** → status "Waiting".
3. You check your bank/UPI statement for that UTR and amount, then in **Admin → Payments** tap **Approve** (or **Reject** with a reason).
4. Approve extends the plan: `new expiry = later of (now, current expiry) + plan days` — unused days are kept.

Built-in protections (all enforced in the database, not in the app): the price always comes from the plans table; a customer can only create *pending* payments for themselves; one pending payment per customer; a UTR can only be used once; only owner/manager accounts can approve; a double-tap cannot approve twice; customers can never write to their own subscription.

## Step 8 — Test checklist

- [ ] Fresh install → the app opens straight on **Home**; Home/Channels/Shows can be browsed without signing in.
- [ ] Tap **Play** on anything while signed out → the sign-in screen appears; after signing in the video starts.
- [ ] Signed in without a plan: free titles play fully; premium titles show trailer / 30-sec preview then "See plans".
- [ ] **Continue with Google** works.
- [ ] **Email me a sign-in link** → open link on the phone → signed in.
- [ ] Admin: set password, sign in, create a channel, upload a free title and a premium title, turn them LIVE.
- [ ] Upload a **Hidden Premium** title → it must NOT appear for a customer without a plan.
- [ ] As a customer, pick a plan → submit a test UTR → shows "Waiting".
- [ ] Admin → Payments → Approve → customer's Profile shows "Active · until …", premium plays fully, hidden title appears.
- [ ] Try to submit the same UTR again → blocked.

**Sign-in safety rule:** whenever you change anything in Supabase Authentication or Google Cloud, immediately test both Google sign-in and email sign-in on a real phone. If people report login problems, first check the Google provider still has its Client ID/secret and that the redirect URLs above are still present.

## Step 9 — Publish to the Play Store (later)

**Build → Generate Signed App Bundle / APK → Android App Bundle** → create a new keystore (**back it up — you can't update the app without it**) → release. Upload the `.aab` in Google Play Console.

Note: Google Play's payment policy requires Play Billing for digital content bought inside apps distributed on Play. Manual UPI is fine for direct APK distribution or your website; check Play's current policy before publishing there.

## Known limits

- **30-second previews** (premium titles with no trailer) are stopped by the app at 30 s. The video file itself has to be streamable for that, so a technical user could watch past 30 s. Uploading a trailer for every premium title avoids this — then non-subscribers only ever get the trailer file.
- Video is streamed as a single MP4 file. For large audiences, a video service with adaptive streaming (e.g. Cloudflare Stream, Mux) is the next upgrade.
